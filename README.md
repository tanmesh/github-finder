# GitHub Finder App Design Documentation

## Introduction

The GitHub Finder App is a straightforward yet powerful React application designed to display GitHub user profiles. It offers essential functionalities for searching and viewing information from GitHub profiles, including recent repositories. The application leverages GitHub APIs for accessing user data and incorporates advanced features like state and effect hooks, context, and a reducer for state management. This document outlines the main functionalities and provides insights into the app's architecture.

## Main Functionalities

The GitHub Finder App provides the following primary functionalities:

1. **User Search:** Users can search for a specific GitHub user by entering their username. The app utilizes the GitHub API to fetch user data.

2. **User Profile Display:** The app displays essential information from the user's GitHub profile, including their name, bio, location, avatar, and a link to their GitHub profile.

3. **Recent Repositories:** Users can view a list of recent repositories from the user's profile, along with important details such as repository name, description, and the number of stars and forks.

## Technologies Used

The GitHub Finder App is built using the following technologies:

- **React:** The core framework for building the user interface.
- **GitHub API:** Utilized to access user data and repositories from GitHub profiles.
- **State Hook:** Used to manage the application's state within React components.
- **Effect Hook:** Employed for handling side effects, such as fetching data from the GitHub API.
- **Context:** Utilized for managing and providing application-level state and functions to child components.
- **Reducer:** Applied for complex state management, especially for handling user and repository data.

## Application Architecture

The application follows a component-based architecture and uses the following key components:

1. **App.js:** The main application component that wraps the entire app. It sets up the context provider for managing user and repository data.

2. **Search.js:** This component handles the user search input and interaction. It triggers the user data fetch from the GitHub API.

3. **User.js:** Responsible for displaying the user's profile information.

4. **Repos.js:** Displays the list of recent repositories and their details.

5. **Alert.js:** Provides alerts or messages to the user based on specific actions or results.

## Data Retrieval

The GitHub Finder App fetches user data and repositories using the GitHub API. The API requests are triggered when a user is searched, and the data is retrieved in JSON format.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- **src**
  - **components**: Contains the React components for the application. Like repos, assets, layout, shared, users 
  - **context**: Holds the context and context provider for managing user and repository data.
  
## Getting Started

To run the GitHub Finder App on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the necessary dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Start the development server using `npm start`.

## Conclusion
The GitHub Finder App is a user-friendly and functional application for exploring GitHub user profiles and their recent repositories. It effectively showcases the implementation of core React concepts and tools, including state and effect hooks, context for state management, and the use of a reducer for handling complex data.

## Future Work
While the GitHub Finder App already offers a valuable set of features, there are several areas of potential improvement and expansion:

**User Authentication**: Consider adding user authentication to enable users to save their favorite profiles and personalize their experience.

**Advanced Search Filters**: Enhance the search functionality with filters and sorting options to provide more comprehensive and tailored search results.

**User Profile Comparison**: Allow users to compare multiple GitHub profiles side by side, making it easier to analyze and contrast different users.

**Data Visualization**: Incorporate data visualization libraries to represent statistics about a user's repositories, such as commit history, programming languages used, and more.

These four future work suggestions aim to make the GitHub Finder App even more robust and feature-rich. Prioritize enhancements that align with your project's goals and user needs, and consider actively engaging with the user community for feedback and feature requests.
